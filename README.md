# cwz

To get started with python (on windows) and try the demo code for exchange apis: 
1) Install Anaconda(64bit) from anaconda.org (make sure to check "add to path" during installation) 
2) Now we can python commands from the command line, so start a command prompt (win+r - cmd - enter) 
3) Install usefull libraries with the command: pip install python-binance ccxt talib tulipy nbopen
    - unfortunately there might be something that does not install, as pip is a bit buggy  
4) Make it easy to directly open ipynb files with this command: 
    - python -m nbopen.install_win 
5) Finally, dobble click the the cwzdemo.ipynb, which should now open in a jupyter window in your browser
